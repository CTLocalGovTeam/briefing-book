# briefing-book

The Briefing Book application allows GIS professionals to author briefing/map book web applications.
The application will also be used to modify existing contents and re-publish it in users own environment.
A prototype developed by Esri will be used in concert with the specifications to guide application development.
Briefing/Map Book will be accessed from browsers on tablets and desktops.
